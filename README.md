## 📝 About this project

The goal of this project was to reproduce a published chart in order to:  

- Practice working with **Matplotlib** and other visualization libraries.  
- Explore the process of translating an existing design into code.  
- Better understand the design choices made in the original visualization.  

The dataset and original chart come from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/), and all credit for the data and original design belongs to them.
